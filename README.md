# Eye-Power-Verification-System

I have built a eye power detection system by calculating the depth of user's eye from webcam and then use len's formula to determine approximate power of user's eye.

## Assusmptions Made
1. User's eye shape is perfectly spherical as I am only determining spherical power.
2. Individual eye power is not calculated depending on user's input to program that eye's power is calculated.
3. Maximum power of +-3.5 D is calculated.
